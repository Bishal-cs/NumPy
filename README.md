This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) dedicated to learning and practicing **NumPy**, the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

The notebook covers:
- Installation and setup of NumPy
- Creation and manipulation of arrays
- Indexing, slicing, and iterating
- Mathematical operations on arrays
- Statistical methods
- Broadcasting and vectorization
- Real-world practice examples
